In this third and last installment we improve the content and appearance, add typical CRUD functions, implement firebase hosting services and work on the RSS of this project.

I have to say, my project is based on another one I saw here: https://www.figma.com/community/file/891374608655348853/website-of-architects-free-website

## About The Project
In the Queries section you can see the finished projects destined to be sold, and if you want to know their details you must write the name in Contact.

A new section of houses of the community is added where people can add the house they want to sell so that people can see its location and size.

In the Contact section, if a login system is implemented you will be able to see your selling requests, and the questionnaire to add them which includes a method to modify and delete.
